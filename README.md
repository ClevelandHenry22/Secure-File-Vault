#  SecureFileVault  
### Advanced File Encryption Tool (Python + Cryptography)

SecureFileVault is a **professional file & directory encryption tool** built using the Python `cryptography` library (Fernet AES-128).  
It is designed as a **real-world cybersecurity project** that demonstrates:

-  Strong Encryption  
-  Secure Key Management  
-  CLI-Based Cybersecurity Tooling  
-  Folder-Level Encryption  
-  Key Rotation  
-  Error Handling & Validation  
-  Clean, Clear, Well-Commented Code  

This tool is useful for **blue-team ops, secure data handling, forensics environments, and personal security**.

#  Features

###  File Encryption  
Encrypt any file using AES-128 (Fernet standard).

###  File Decryption  
Recover original files securely.

###  Directory Encryption  
Encrypt *every file* in a folder at once.

###  Directory Decryption  
Decrypt every `.enc` file recursively.

###  Key Generation  
Create strong Fernet keys & store them safely.

###  Key Rotation  
Rotate keys without breaking the application.

###  Detailed Logging & Error Handling  
Made for real-world use cases.



#  Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SecureFileVault.git
cd SecureFileVault
pip install cryptography
```

---

#  Usage

###  Generate a new key
```bash
python secure_file_vault.py --generate-key --key-file vault.key
```

---

###  Encrypt a file
```bash
python secure_file_vault.py --encrypt secret.txt --output secret.enc --key-file vault.key
```

---

###  Decrypt a file
```bash
python secure_file_vault.py --decrypt secret.enc --output secret.txt --key-file vault.key
```

---

###  Encrypt a whole directory
```bash
python secure_file_vault.py --encrypt-dir myfolder --key-file vault.key
```

---

###  Decrypt a directory
```bash
python secure_file_vault.py --decrypt-dir myfolder --key-file vault.key
```

---

###  Rotate encryption key
```bash
python secure_file_vault.py --rotate-key --key-file vault.key
```

#  How Encryption Works (Simplified)

SecureFileVault uses **Fernet** from the Python `cryptography` library.

Fernet guarantees:

- AES-128 encryption  
- HMAC authentication  
- Timestamped tokens  
- No silent corruption  

This ensures **confidentiality + integrity** of your data.

#  Real-World Use Cases

-  Protecting sensitive logs  
-  Encrypting incident-response evidence  
-  Safeguarding credentials  
-  Backing up sensitive config files  
-  Secure local storage for small businesses  
-  Cybersecurity learning & demonstrations  

---

#  Security Notes

- Keep your key file (`vault.key`) private  
- Do NOT upload the key to GitHub  
- Rotate keys periodically  
- Delete original unencrypted files after encryption  
- For forensic-level deletion, use tools like:  
  - `shred`, `srm`, `wipe`
